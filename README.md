# mooc_disengagement_factors

This project was developed in the context of my Master Thesis "MOOC Interrupted: Determination of (Dis-)Engagement Factors using Sentiment Analysis." at the Humboldt University of Berlin under the supervision of Prof.Dr Stephan Lessmann. This project is comformed by two parts: 
	1- the first crawler extracts main features (including the URL) of a list of courses, using the surface of the platform Coursera.
	2- the second crawler uses this (selected-) URL list and for each URL link opens the page and extracts (over the embedded pages) all posted reviews.
